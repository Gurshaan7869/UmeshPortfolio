My tasks included analyzing compromised systems, identifying vulnerabilities, and producing reports that were shared with law enforcement authorities. This ultimately led to the apprehension of the criminals involved. During this situation, I demonstrated my skill in handling pressure while upholding confidentiality and professionalism.

        "description": "In another significant project, I conducted a comprehensive penetration test on an application. This test revealed a chain of vulnerabilities that could lead to an admin takeover. This assessment involved multiple URLs and endpoints, including login and OTP submission endpoints. I identified several issues: user enumeration, backward-compatible API versioning, and lack of rate limiting. By exploiting these vulnerabilities, I was able to demonstrate a critical security flaw. Specifically, I discovered that while the newer API endpoint correctly implemented rate limiting, the older version did not. This discrepancy allowed me to initiate a brute force attack using BurpSuite's intruder on the older endpoint, successfully bypassing OTP protections and gaining access to the admin account. Once I had control over the admin account, I demonstrated the vulnerabilityâ€™s impact by logging into the admin dashboard. This significant discovery highlights the need to address these security issues thoroughly. In my role, I have pinpointed these vulnerabilities and their origins and also provided detailed suggestions for addressing them. These recommendations included setting up error messages, eliminating API versions, and implementing rate limiting across all OTP endpoints."
